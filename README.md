Hi, I’m Alfredo.  

I’m interested in electronic, firmware and software development.  
I have worked for 19 years as a developer but in the last 5 years I have moved away from coding.  
When I can, in my little free time, I like to write something just for fun.  
If you want to know more about me visit my LinkedIn profile.
